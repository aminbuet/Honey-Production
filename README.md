# Honey-Production

In this project, I try to show how linear regression works of real-world data.

As we may have already heard, the honeybees are in a precarious state right now. We may have seen articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. We want to investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.

We have loaded in a DataFrame for you about honey production in the United States from Kaggle. It is called df and has the following columns:

  ..1.state
  ..2.numcol
  ..3.yieldpercol
  ..4.totalprod
  ..5.stocks
  ..6.priceperlb
  ..7.prodvalue
  ..8.year

Note: All the tasks can be completed using Pandas or NumPy. Pick whichever one we prefer.
